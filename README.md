***library under construction***

Nature
======
The Nature library provides a class (`Thing`) which creates objects with strict, per-property type and value checking. This enables more fine-grained classification base on type *and* state. Say you have a `Person` class, with nature you can create a sub-class of `Person` in a particular state, e.g. `Drunkard`, `Scoundrel`, `Leader` etc. These Things can be reused, subclassed or merged with other Things to create new hybrids. The `Thing` class adds these features to each new object:

* Type and value validation per property
* Data loading from the command line, environment, external file or plain object
* Merging and cloning
* Property grouping and filtering
* Mechanism for duck typing

Synopsis
--------

Enables you to write an API method like: (`Scoundrel` and `FlammableCar` are derivitives of `Thing`)
```javascript
exports.burnCar = function(arsonist){
    var scoundrel = new Scoundrel(arsonist);
    if (!scoundrel.valid){
        throw new Error(scoundrel.validationMessages.join("\n"));
        // throws:
        // The arsonist supplied must be a Scoundrel, you passed a Metrosexual
        // Invalid age 29: Must be between 11 and 19. 
        // Over 5 litres Gasoline required
        // Less compassion necessary.
    } else {
        var car = new FlammableCar(process.env);
        if (car.valid){
            // the Vauxhall Astra supplied in the environment is indeed flammable
            scoundrel.igniteCar(car);
        }
    }
}
```
Client code for the above is straight forward. In this case `burnCar()` input is taken directly from the command line. You can also pass the environment (`process.env`), an object literal or a `Thing` instance. 
```javascript
var outdoors = require("outdoor-activity");
outdoors.burnCar(process.argv);
```
Then a simple command executes the outdoor activity:
```sh
$ CAR_MAKE=Vauxhall CAR_MODEL=Astra node outdoors.js --name Alfie --age 11 --litres 13 --compassion unknown
```
